title: Not Strong, not Stable, but Deadly
---

Many people in the Effective Altruism movement steer clear of talking about politics too much, largely because the tractability of various problems is hard to gauge relative to third-world poverty alleviation. However, some people are certainly starting to investigate the low-hanging fruit in the political sphere.[^1] [^2]

Which got me thinking, what would be the likely impact of electing a non-Tory government in the election in a few weeks time?

There are many relevant policy areas to examine to determine how much suffering Tory policy causes: notably foreign policy and international conflict, climate change, and macroeconomic trends, but the effects of these are hard to measure and the conclusions more likely to be contentious. Therefore Iâ€™ll mostly be focussing on the impacts on health, poverty, and crime, which are much easier to measure in a quasi-objective fashion. Note that all three cause QALY (quality-adjusted life year) loss fairly directly, so are also relatively easy to aggregate.[^title]

## Health
Cutting funding and institutional support for the NHS is a flagship Tory policy. According to a famous and rather well-thought-out JRSM paper, these cuts caused 30 000 excess deaths in 2015.[^h1] [^h2] This effect size is entirely plausible, given that low doctor numbers and high bed occupancy in just 19 PCTs cause 3000 deaths per year,[^h3] and failure to follow through on standard procedures after NSTEMI heart attacks cause 3300/year.[^h4]

## Crime
Theresa May's record as Home Secretary was one of authoritarianism and racist dog-whistling,[^c1] so it is perhaps no surprise that her administration now is not prioritizing the alarming increase in crime created by the press coverage surrounding the Brexit referendum. The last year has seen roughly 62 500 racially- or religiously-aggravated offences (up 47%),[^c2] 750 homophobic violent crimes (up 147%),[^c3] a similar rise in antiziganism,[^c4] and the first MP in 27 years to fall victim to a terrorist attack.

On a lighter note (sorry), cuts to fire services are responsible for roughly 40 excess fire-related deaths a year.[^c5]

## Benefits policy
Welfare policy also has had many drastic effects, including several very direct ones. About 1000 die a year due to the removal of ESA (the successor of Incapacity Benefit) after a Working Capability Assessment ---  a process completely unfit for assessing capability to work,[^b1] [^b2] but very capable of wasting disabled people's time gratuitously on filling in forms that are never read.[^b2forms] The WCAs themselves exacerbate mental health problems and cause hundreds of suicides per year.[^b3] [^b4]

About 3700 died in 2011 while assigned to a "work-related activity" (that is to say, forced into a job) while on ESA.[^b5] Unfortunately more recent statistics are not available because the DWP is trying not to release them.[^b6] Changes in sanctioning policy for Job Seekers' Allowance also take their toll, though Mike Silver's estimate of 41600 per year killed by JSA sanctions is almost certainly unrealistically high.[^b7] [^b8]

It's not just direct death, though; Tory benefits policy is also responsible for a great deal of frustration and social isolation: changes this year have led to the removal of Personal Independence Payment (formally Disability Living Allowance) from 164 000 people who can't leave home alone.[^b9]

Changes to benefits policy (or delays in benefits payments) also drive people to food banks in ever-greater numbers: the Trussell Trust was required to dispense 4027 person-years of food last year by these two causes alone.[^b10]

## Economic policy
What are the health impacts of the economic failure of Tory policy? Well, austerity policies are responsible for about 500 extra suicides per year, 90 000 more reported mental health problems, and 234 000 more antidepressant prescriptions.[^b11] [^b11b] Depression at age 18 is associated with a loss of about 28 quality-adjusted expected years,[^b12] so this is another impact comparable to tens of thousands of annual deaths.

There are about 11 million people living in poverty in the UK today, compared with about 9 million in 2009; over five million of those living in a household in which at least one person is employed.[^b13] Life expectancy is between 5--10 years less in the poorest decile of the UK compared to the richest,[^b14] [^b15] but this is perhaps double-counting the impact of the health and benefits problems above. Fortunately, Stringhini et al. controlled for that and came up with a 2.1 year reduction in quality-adjusted lifespan due to low socioeconomic status specifically.[^b16] The massive increase in the numbers of people living in poverty therefore clocks in as the equivalent of extra annual deaths in the high tens of thousands.

## Other impacts
Harder to quantify but surely greater by orders of magnitude are the expected QALY losses from the effects of unmitigated climate change,[^20] [^21] [^22] from the economic damage from attempts to limit migration,[^23] from the collapse of various export-dependent industries in the wake of Brexit,[^24] or from the increased chance of major international conflict that comes from deliberately antagonizing stable allies.[^25] [^26]

Oh, and then there's the sheer mental and cultural impoverishment of living one's political life in a society that could take seriously such jaded, parochial, pompous, imbecilic non-entities, indifferent to the suffering of others, "in every word or gesture [seeking] to foreclose on all possibilities and draw the furthest boundaries of the sunlit world no further than your respectable lace curtains."[^30]

I certainly wouldn't claim that Theresa May is worse than Hitler. That would be unreasonable.

It's just that Tories don't seem to like trade unionists, the Poles, disabled people, LGBTQ+ people, or the Romani, and their policies are killing Britons faster than World War II ever could.[^war]


[^title]: Epistemic note: For obvious reasons, I'm focussing here on causes of QALY loss and/or death that are most easily quantified and pinned on specific policy, though obviously this will be a conservative [sic] estimate of the impacts. Unlike other avenues of criticism, these are also Tory failures even by their own ideology.

    I'm also focussing on material impacts on British people. This is not for any particular ethical reason, but to ensure that I'm comparing like with like and in order to only have one argument at a time.

    Any corrections or additions to my statistics are welcomed! So are suggestions of how to measure other impacts.
