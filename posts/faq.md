Hi there! I'm Pete, and I'm pansexual. Perhaps you have questions?[^cw]

## What does that mean?
Pansexuality means I experience romantic and sexual attraction to people regardless of gender; or in other words, gender identification and presentation _per se_ has little bearing on how attractive I find a person.

It's a closely-related identification to bisexual, which describes people who are attracted to both similar and dissimilar genders to themselves,[^bi] but pansexual decenters the importance of gender rather than explicitly including multiple genders.

Although I slightly prefer pansexual as a description for this reason, I also happily identify as bisexual and queer.

## Hang on, isn't "queer" offensive?
Well, it was effectively a slur for a while, but it's mostly been reclaimed now.[^qslur] Originally "queer" was used as a self-descriptor by people we'd these days call homosexual or bisexual men in the late-nineteenth century, alongside other euphemisms like "theatrical".[^qba] By the middle of the century it was firmly homophobic and pejorative.

Reclamation efforts date back to at least the 1980s, with political organizations like Queer Nation [^queernation] and Outrage!, and some groups like it precisely because it allows identification with a wider culture without committing to specific letter(s) in the LGBTQ+ alphabet soup.

Of course, not everyone is comfortable with identifying as "queer" themselves. Clearly you shouldn't refer to someone that way directly if they don't like it, and it's probably better in formal/official circumstances to use a more inclusive term like "LGBTQ+".[^alpha]

It can also be useful having the word as a catchall for non-heterosexual and non-cis-binary people and cultures built around what would now be queer identities. For example, Alan Turing certainly wouldn't have identified as "queer", but it's still useful to be able to write "A Queer History of Computing"[^compsci] and he certainly belongs in it!

## Aren't you in a straight marriage?
Well, I am married to a woman. Me and my wife have been happily married for nearly three years, and together for more than eleven. She's known about my sexuality for, well, pretty much all of that time.

However, I don't really like the term "straight marriage" (though some bi/pan people don't mind it), or for that matter "gay marriage". A straight marriage is surely a marriage of straight people, and we aren’t both straight. Bi/pan people don’t just become straight (or gay) when they "settle down".

I don't think this is just splitting hairs, either --- anecdotally, romantic relationships involving queer people seem to have more willingness to consider and discuss feelings about gender rôles and sexuality, on average.

## How does being pan affect you?
My queerness is not that visible in everyday life and I'm a white cis man, so there's definitely a large chunk of material oppression and inconvenience that I'm largely insulated from. There are also lots of contexts in which having a straight-appearing relationship is useful for avoiding confrontation or discussion that's just not germane to the context.

However, bi/pan people still suffer from the constant assumptions about our identity. Bi/pan identities are constantly questioned and scrutinized for justification, in both heteronormative contexts and within queer communities: "Are you sure?", "How do you know?", "Have you ever loved a [insert subgroup]?".[^passing]

There have been multiple cases of bisexual people who have had to defend their sexual identification in court, including a Jamaican man whose asylum application in the USA was denied partly because (then in a relationship with a woman) he couldn't "prove" his sexuality, and partly because bisexuality was not considered persecuted in Jamaica. This even though when a previous relationship with a man had been outed there, he was disowned by his family, pelted with stones and _shot_.[^fuller]

In some ways, bi/pan people also have materially worse life outcomes: 12% of straight US high-schoolers "seriously consider" suicide, compared to 30% of lesbian and gay students and 40% of bisexual ones. Bisexual women, in particular, face higher rates of poverty, and far higher rates of sexual violence than straight women or lesbians.[^map]

Personally, I've also suffered from internalized homophobia. The prevailing heteronormativity in society and my struggle with/against my identity has been partly responsible for times in my life characterized by denial, shame, self-loathing, and depression.[^mental]

## So why come out at all?
Good question! I've survived for this long without doing so, so why now? There are three main reasons:

#### 1. Visibility
Bi/pan people are not terribly visible in society, despite there being way more of us than LG people.[^bistats] I want to be more visible as a pansexual man partly because better queer visibility means it's less likely that young people will suffer in the way I did, and more likely that they will feel they can be happy with themselves. I want people to be confident that if they come out, there will be someone there to support them.

Visibility also means visibility to straight potential allies that haven't thought much about queer political issues or inclusivity. Everyone knows queer people, but not everyone realizes it! The more we are able to talk about it, the more people will realize that LGBTQ+ issues affect real people that they personally know, and the more that they will realize that heteronormativity and gender essentialism hurts everyone, straight people included.

#### 2. Belonging and identification
The second reason is a little more personal. For one reason and another, I have quite a few queer friends now, and the culture of queer-coded spaces is generally really fun and positive! I enjoy being in that kind of space and that kind of conversation, and it's been one of the main things that has helped me fully come to terms with embracing the pan identity.

#### 3. Political solidarity

The third reason is to express solidarity with other queer and marginalized people who have it way worse than me, for whom daily interactions are much more painful and whose rights to exist and live are still being debated near-constantly. There is a recurring pattern where someone experiencing a problem is constantly asked to explain it, or even to argue that the problem really exists. As someone who isn't constantly forced to justify my existence, I feel it's part of my duty to take on some of that burden of convincing and educating others.

In particular, we have a massive transphobia problem in the UK at the moment,[^transphobia] especially relative to how we're doing on LGB rights. Most LGB people are not transphobes, but the constant media attention to transphobic and especially transmisogynistic narratives create an incredibly hostile environment for trans people to exist in.

And so I like making this kind of post and conversation because it gives me a good opportunity to remind queer people and allies (and myself) to work to centre and amplify the voices of those suffering in complex and intersecting hierarchies of oppression in a way that doesn't force them to do of their own heavy lifting.

And to say to trans people, queer minority ethnic people, queer sex workers, and all those others actively suffering: I see you. You're welcome in our community, and our community should be fighting for you.

## Isn't this just part of a fashionable trend?
Well, modern categories of identification and a reasonable understanding of the construction of gender are products of the last century or so, true.[^hirschfeld] Our concepts of "homosexual" and "trans woman" didn't really exist in the same way 130 years ago, and people wouldn't have identified that way.

However, if you look at behaviours rather than identification, history abounds with same-sex relationships[^gay-history] (and people who had relationships with both sexes[^bi-history]), "third gender"-type concepts,[^hijra-history] and people living as the "opposite" sex.[^trans-history] The oldest literate civilization on earth had trans women living in it, and the oldest named author in history writes about them.[^sumer]

## Things move so fast these days. How can I keep up with all the PC terminology?
Well, good news! If you are genuinely worried about this, you’re more likely to be able to learn and not repeat mistakes. The most important thing is to listen to people and trust how they report their experiences --- people are likely to know best about how they would like to be treated. I also think it’s well worth getting into the habit of referring to unknown or abstract people with gender-neutral terminology: that can help not just to weaken heteronormativity and allow space for non-binary people, but also to avoid perpetuating latent sexist assumptions.

People make mistakes, and no-one expects you to be at the forefront of all the cultural and political progress at once. If you accidentally make a homophobic remark, or misgender someone, or someone tells you you're using insensitive language, all you need to do is apologize and think about why whatever-it-was might have been hurtful. Changing linguistic habits takes practice, but people notice when you try, and appreciate it.

## I have more questions…
OK, great! I wouldn't have used this format if I didn't want further questions. Please feel free to ask me them through whatever means of communication we normally use.

Thanks for listening.[^ack]

[^cw]: (cw: homophobia, transphobia)
[^bi]: That is, not attracted to "men" and "women", but both "homosexual" and "heterosexual". The idea that "bisexual" as a term necessarily upholds a gender binary is a relatively new one, and one that [right-wing groups are keen to promote](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/droptheb-hashtag-4chan/), in order to disturb the solidarity between bisexual and non-binary people. Gosh, that was an early digression.
[^qslur]: Being reclaimed doesn’t mean it’s never used pejoratively any more, of course; "gay" is used pejoratively too, but few would claim that it means it hasn’t been reclaimed by LGBTQ+ people.
[^qba]: See [this](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/queer-british-art-1861-1967) historical note accompanying the Tate exhibition 'Queer British Art 1861–1967'.
[^queernation]: ['Queers Read This'](http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this
): leaflet published by Queer Nation and promulgated at a NYC Pride march, 1990.
[^alpha]: "LGBTQ+" is a pretty good solution for this which has recently gained popularity relative to "LGBTQIA", partly because many but not all aro/ace or intersex people regard themselves as part of the community.
[^compsci]: [Like this!](http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/feb/19/queer-computing-1/)
[^passing]: [Here's](https://thoughtcatalog.com/gaby-dunn/2012/12/on-passing-for-straight/) an interesting account by a bi woman, Gaby Dunn, of how the "straight-passing" narrative has hurt her specifically.

The UK Border Force and immigration detention system are also [institutionally](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/No_Going_Back__2010_.pdf) [homophobic](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/no_safe_refuge.pdf).
[^map]: [Here's the study](http://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/invisible-majority) from 2016, on the US bisexual community.
[^mental]: I'm in a much better mental place now, thanks for asking!
[^bistats]: This is kinda hard to study, because lots of people (especially older people) tend to "round themselves off" to straight when asked. However, see [this](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/08/16/half-young-not-heterosexual/) and [this](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/lgbt_in_britain_work_report.pdf), for example. 
[^transphobia]: Much of it [organized](https://twitter.com/caseyexplosion/status/1015990157634306048) and [bankrolled](https://twitter.com/CaseyExplosion/status/1005517283723276288) by the same American evangelical anti-LGBT groups that also tried to sabotage the Irish abortion referendum. Transphobic views are also given disproportionately large platforms in even relatively socially liberal media outlets like the _Observer_ and _Guardian_.
[^hirschfeld]: A friend reminds me that it’s not clear to what extent our understanding of sexuality and gender now is further advanced from that of Magnus Hirschfeld's _Institut für Sexualwissenschaft_ in the early 1930s. And now we’ll never know, because the institute was destroyed and their library and archive was burnt by the National Socialist German Students' League in May 1933. Nazi anti-gay legislation was enforced in West Germany (encouraged by the Western Allies) until 1969, and the last remnant only removed in 1994.
[^gay-history]: [An example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khnumhotep_and_Niankhkhnum), and for more on ancient Egypt, see [this](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fa37/c10db9ec909252f93e82ef74189e4c2f1a87.pdf). There are many more of these examples in Holland, _The Nature of Homosexuality_, and Dynes (ed.), _Encyclopædia of Homosexuality_.
[^bi-history]: Most famously in Ancient Greece and Rome, though same-sex relationships there were generally highly asymmetrical and layered with (to us, often disturbing!) gendered connotation.
[^hijra-history]: For example, [two-spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit) people in many Native American cultures, or [hijra](http://www.india.com/lifestyle/the-history-of-hijras-south-asias-transsexual-and-transgender-community-540754/) in South Asia.
[^trans-history]: [Example from stone-age central Europe](https://web.archive.org/web/20140204003857/http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.ca/2011/04/grave-of-stone-age-transsexual.html#.W0IyYBgh1pg). [Here's](http://10oclockdot.tumblr.com/post/145453478037/saying-that-man-and-woman-are-the-only-genders-is) a nice little slide deck pointing out that "People have two genders: men and women" is less accurate than "Matter has four consituents: fire, earth, water, and air".

[^ack]: And thanks to the several friends who took a look at this, helped me edit it, and encouraged me to post it! :grin:
